===========================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/gmp-frontend.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/gmp-frontend) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/gmp-frontend/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/gmp-frontend/_latestVersion)

This service provides the frontend application for the Guaranteed Minimum Pension service.

Summary
--------

This service is designed for Pension Scheme Administrators and Pension Scheme Practitioners to request a [GMP] calculation
for a member of a contracted-out scheme under the following circumstances:

* The member is reaching State Pension Age
* The member is leaving the scheme
* The member has died and the surviving spouse requires a statement
* The member is transferring to another scheme
* The member is getting divorced


Requirements
------------

This service is written in [Scala] and [Play], so needs at least a [JRE] to run.


Authentication
------------

This user logs into this service using the [Government Gateway]

## Code formatting (scalafmt)

This project uses [scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt/) via the `sbt-scalafmt` plugin.

- To format the main and test source code:

  ```bash
  sbt scalafmtAll
  ```

- To format only the main sources:

  ```bash
  sbt scalafmt
  ```

- To format only the test sources:

  ```bash
  sbt test:scalafmt
  ```

Formatting is **not** wired into `compile` by default. Run `scalafmt`/`scalafmtAll` separately (for example, before committing or as part of a CI check), and use `compile` just for compilation.
